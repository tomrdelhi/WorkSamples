These files are from a project I worked on as part of the Business and Software and Capstone Projects courses at the University of Toronto.
The course revolved around the development of a viable business plan and monetization model for a software application you created in groups of three to five. Our application used various techniques to analyze a selfie and recommend appropriate cosmetics. By the end of the course it could analyze skin colour, adapt to lighting conditions and recommend foundation.
I was in charge of front end development (as well as various business side responsibilities) and developed the included files to allow the user to take and submit a photo and display results. For simplicity and demonstrabilities sake the files do not access the back-end algorithms and simply choose one of a few colours and products at random.
